    "# Data Preparation and Preprocessing Summary\n",
    "The data that was given in .csv format was loaded into a DataFrame using the **read_csv()** method from the **pandas** library.\n",
    "### Cleaning the data\n",
    "- Used regex to clean the \"Date\" & \"Id\" column before converting the data type of \"Date\" attribute from **object** to **datetime64[ns]** and \"Id\" attribute **object** to **int64**\n",
    "- All other attributes have the correct data types:  \n",
    "    - **LowestSalary** and **HighestSalary** are **int64**\n",
    "    - **AverageSalary** are **float64**\n",
    "    - All other attributes are **objects**\n",
    "### Duplicated data\n",
    "- **8607** duplicate job listings were removed form the dataset. We know that these weren't just repeated job postings because the \"Date\" attribute was include when looking at duplicate entries. \n",
    "- There an additional **6724** duplicate job listings without considering the \"Date\" attribute, this most likely represents job listings that weren't filled and were reposted after some time. These additional duplicates were not removed from the dataset, because these job listings still had useful contextual information.\n",
    "### Missing data\n",
    "- The most notable attribute is that **Area** has the highest missing data at **61.50%** It is suspected that only job listings with a **Location** based in the larger cities; **Sydney**, **Brisbane**, **Melbourne** and **Perth** use the **Area** attribute to be more specific regarding the location of the job. This also leads to the early observation that those cities make up at least **38.50%** of the dataset.\n",
    "- The second observation regarding missing data was that the **Location**, **Classification** and **SubClassification** attribute all shared the same amount of missing data of **38.08%**. After some investigation it was found that all job listings between the **16th of December 2018** to the **13th of March 2019** inclusive, were missing **Classification**, **SubClassification** and **Location** attribute data. Job listings outside the date range were checked for missing data, but nothing of interest was found. Precautions must be taken before drawing conclusions from data related to **Location**, **Classification** and **SubClassification** attributes.\n",
    "# Hypothesis\n",
    "- We expect the large majority of job listings to be located in the larger cities; **Sydney**, **Brisbane**, **Melbourne** and **Perth**. With a focus on the eastern coast since that is the more densely populated parts of Australia\n",
    "- Because the larger cities hold a greater share of the job listings, it should be expected that the average salary would also be higher in these cities compared to remote locations. \n",
    "- The most popular job listings expected would be Information & Communication Technology, due to the increase in demand and use of technology. \n",
    "- The expected highest average salary would be CEO & General Management, but this could be considered an outlier due to the large gap expected between this classification and the rest. The popularity of Information & Communication Technology would also have a competitive aspect to average salary, driving it up."
